# Experiments

This directory contains results and analysis of different approaches to Agentic Coding.

## Purpose

Experiments help:

- Compare the effectiveness of different prompts and workflows
- Measure the impact of specific rules and constraints
- Document successful and unsuccessful approaches
- Provide evidence for best practices
- Track improvements in LLM-assisted coding techniques over time

## Structure

Each experiment should include:

1. **Objective**: What the experiment aims to test or compare
2. **Methodology**: The approach, prompts, and workflows used
3. **Results**: The outcomes and generated code or artifacts
4. **Analysis**: Evaluation of the results and insights gained
5. **Conclusions**: Recommendations based on the experiment
