# Agentic Coding Sandbox

This project is a sandbox for exploring and developing Agentic Coding techniques using LLMs (Large Language Models). It focuses specifically on tools like cline, GitHub Copilot, and Claude for AI-assisted coding.

## Purpose

- Experiment with different prompting techniques for code generation and modification
- Develop best practices for LLM-assisted coding workflows
- Test and refine rules and guidelines for effective collaboration between humans and AI
- Create reusable templates and patterns for common coding tasks

## Structure

- `.clinerules`: Code style settings for the cline tool
- `.github/`: GitHub configuration files, including Copilot instructions and prompts
- `CLAUDE.md`: Guidelines and best practices for working with Claude

## Getting Started

Explore the configuration files to understand how to effectively use cline, GitHub Copilot, and Claude for AI-assisted coding. These tools can help you develop more effective coding practices with LLM assistance.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to improve the existing configuration files or add new resources related to cline, GitHub Copilot, or Claude to help build a comprehensive resource for Agentic Coding techniques.
