# Agentic Coding Sandbox

This project is a sandbox for exploring and developing Agentic Coding techniques using LLMs (Large Language Models). It provides a structured environment for testing prompts, rules, and workflows for AI-assisted coding.

## Purpose

- Experiment with different prompting techniques for code generation and modification
- Develop best practices for LLM-assisted coding workflows
- Test and refine rules and guidelines for effective collaboration between humans and AI
- Create reusable templates and patterns for common coding tasks

## Structure

- `/prompts`: Collection of effective prompts for various coding tasks
- `/rules`: Guidelines and constraints for LLM behavior
- `/workflows`: Step-by-step processes for common development activities
- `/templates`: Reusable code and documentation templates
- `/experiments`: Results and analysis of different approaches

## Getting Started

Explore the different directories to understand the various aspects of Agentic Coding. Experiment with prompts and workflows to develop more effective coding practices with LLM assistance.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please add your own prompts, rules, workflows, or experiment results to help build a comprehensive resource for Agentic Coding techniques.
